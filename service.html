                    The shoes had been there for as long as anyone could remember. In fact, it was difficult for anyone
                    to come up with a

                    removed them was a question that had been asked time and again, but while they all thought it,
                    nobody had ever found the
                    energy to actually do it. So, the shoes remained on the steps, out of place in one sense, but
                    perfectly normal in
                    another.
